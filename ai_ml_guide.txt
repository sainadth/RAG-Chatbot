# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Guide

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples:
- Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Association Rules

### Reinforcement Learning
An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns:

### Neural Network Architectures
- Feedforward Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformer Architecture

### Applications
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Autonomous Vehicles

## RAG Systems
Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines information retrieval with text generation:

1. **Document Processing**: Convert documents into searchable chunks
2. **Embedding Generation**: Create vector representations of text
3. **Vector Storage**: Store embeddings in a database
4. **Query Processing**: Convert questions into vectors
5. **Retrieval**: Find relevant document chunks
6. **Generation**: Use retrieved context to generate answers

## Best Practices
- Data Quality is crucial
- Regular model evaluation
- Consider ethical implications
- Continuous learning and adaptation
